# Team Profile Generator
  
  ## Description
  This project allows one to assemble a team profile consisting of a manager, engineers, and interns. It used jest which allows me to create tests and functions that would make those tests pass. Then, using inquirer, it gives the user prompts which allow them to dynamically create their team profile for whatever project they happen to be working on. After all prompts are answered and the user chooses to not add anymore employees, the HTML is generated under page.html.
